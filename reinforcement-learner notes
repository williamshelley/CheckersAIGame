keeping track of the weights (a vector)
have to be able to calculate the features (a vector), types ex: num pieces per row are decided arbitrarily based on the game
each feature should have its own function
need to update a file per reinforcement learner with new weights
v(s) = v(s) + alpha( v(s-prime) - v(s) )
an episode is one entire game
